# Tower of Doom
Player takes on the role of a Knight, a hero who has lost five pieces of his soul to different monsters. The objective of the game is to battle through a tower, defeat each monster, and retrieve the missing soul piece. Each monster represents a different emotion, such as fear, anger, grief, pride, and mortality.
## Use of AI tools
### Chat GPT
 - Wrote the whole storyline for the game, including descriptions & summaries even for this readme.
 - Came up with all of the monster types and their background.
 - Immensely helped with Nuxt 3 as it's only been a single 'stable' version released, the docs are all over the place but Chat GPT seems to be handling it really well. I've found more answers to my errors & how to use certain features through Chat GPT vs their official docs. 

 ### Midjourney AI
 - Most if not all of the assets within the game have been created by Midjourney AI.
 - This includes all backgrounds, player characters and enemy monsters.


 ## Leiapix
 - Found this randomly, not fully sure if it uses AI but it's really cool, it adds 3D effect to your 2D images.
 - Used this on the assets generated by Midjourney AI to convert them into gifs with that 3D effect.
